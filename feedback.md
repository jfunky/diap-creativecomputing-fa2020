#### Based on work by Marina Zurkow & others at ITP-NYU

### Seeking Feedback
Your job isn’t to convince your critics that your project is a good one. Your job is to give the best representation of your idea possible and leave yourself open to honest criticism of your work without the need to justify or defend it. 

* Prepare a clear and specific statement of what you’re trying to achieve. State the minimal amount of information: Where ideally would this project be experience and who is your audience/user base? (Everyone/anyone is not a user base.)
* Show rather than tell your idea as much as possible.
* Don’t analyze or interpret your work for your critics.
* Know what you want to get out of the feedback. Prepare open-ended questions that get at specific aspects of your project you’re unsure of. (e.g. What did you take away from this project? versus Do you get that my project is about x?)
* Decide for yourself what feedback is relevant. To avoid only absorbing the feedback you want to hear, have someone take notes for you.

#### What constitutes a clearly stated goal?
* What is the project about?
* What is it? Is it a framework for changing behavior?
* What is the context in which it will be experienced? Where, how and when?
* Who is the user, participant or audience?
* What is this project asking them to do?
* What do you want them to take away from the project?

### Providing Feedback
Your job is to help the creator(s) of the project meet their goals. Can you separate your personal taste and world view from your feedback?

* Describe what you experienced.
* What did you see, hear, smell, touch, taste? Describe sensory qualities like:
    - light, dark, opaque
    - geometric/organic
    - texture
    - space (positive/negative)
    - balance
    - symmetry/asymmetry
    - line quality (thick, sharp, continuous)
    - loud
    - melodic
* What did you feel? (Be specific! e.g. despair or disappointment versus sad.) Use aesthetic descriptors like:
    - bright
    - dramatic
    - scientific
    - hard
    - soft
    - peaceful
    - gloomy
* What did you understand? What didn’t you understand?
* What does this remind you of?
* What do you remember? What stood out to you?
* Analyze why you experienced what you experienced.
* Interpret the meaning of what you experienced.
* Evaluate the experience.

#### Framework for Evaluation
* Is the goal a worthwhile one?
* Is there an insight, a novel approach?
* Does it address a real need?
* In what ways does the project achieve its goals? In what way does it fall short? 
* If the project falls short of its goals, are there other contexts in which this project can be impactful?
